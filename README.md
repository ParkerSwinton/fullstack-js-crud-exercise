# Plexxis Interview Exercise

## Requirements

Create a simple but impressive (looks good, works well, has intuitive design, etc.) CRUD application that can do the following:

1. Retrieve employees from a REST API
2. Display the employees in a React application
3. Has UI mechanisms for creating and deleting employees
4. Has API endpoints for creating and deleting employees
5. Edit your version of the `README.md` file to explain to us what things you did, where you focussed your effort, etc.

_Read over the `Bonus` objectives and consider tackling those items as well_

## Bonus (Highly Encouraged)

1. Use a relational database to store the data (SQLite, MariaDB, Postgres)
2. UI mechanisms to edit/update employee data
3. Add API endpoint to update employee data
4. Use [React Table](https://react-table.js.org)

## Other Technologies

You are permitted to use the following if you prefer ...

1. TypeScript, Front-end or backend.
2. NestJS, back end.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The front-end app runs off localhost:3000. The REST API is located in the /server folder and runs off localhost:8080. The data is being served from a JSON file located in the /server/data folder. Run `npm start` to start both servers.

## Getting it Done

- You are free to use whatever libraries that you want. Be prepared to speak to your decisions.
- There is no time limit. Use as little or as much time as is necessary, but aim to get it done within a week. If you need more time it's no problem, but you must let us know. Sometimes life happens. That's ok.
- Fork or clone our repository into your own repository.
  - Send us the link when you are done the exercise (pglinker at plexxis dot com).

When you are done, we'll schedule a zoom call with you where you will share your screen, demo the application for us, and walk us through the code while we ask questions about it.
